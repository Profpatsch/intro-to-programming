= Introduction to programming

Runs on a http://nixos.org/nixos/download.html#virtualbox-appliances[NixOS Virtualbox appliance]. Alternatively, copy the necessary packages in a working NixOS (at that point you should know what you are doing).

. Clone this repository to your homedir.
. Install the programs in the `configuration.nix`.
. Run init.sh (untested!) (or manually execute the steps in it).
. To init Emacs, start it and run `M-x package-list-packages` once, then restart.

`tutorial.adoc` contains my notes for the introductory course, German only and probably of no use to anyone else. :)
